# Basecamp42_SP
Processo seletivo 42 São Paulo - modelo não presencial.

Code made by me for the selection process of Escolé 42 São Paulo in February 2022.

the goal was to know the basics of programming, 

thus going through topics such as Shell, pointers, memory allocation, vectors among other things, 

especially in the c programming language, learning in pairs, we learn from each other during the process, without the help of teachers.
